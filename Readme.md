# Powershell Tools

A collection of scripts and functions (in a module) that I've written and/or adapted over the course of my IT career.
I use many of these functions/scripts on a daily basis. I hope you find them useful, too!

Requirements for the scripts and module(s) 
- [Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)

### Installing

Clone the repo, load the module or run the script.
Most functions are self-explanatory or include help info.
